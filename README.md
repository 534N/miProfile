#miProfile

The start of interesting profile/resume. 
The point of this is to bind me with a timeline, as well as the locations of the events. It's just an implementation I put together real quick to visualize my idea, I just thought it looked more interesting and may get more 'click throughs' :)

##live demo
http://miprofile.meteor.com

##To test it:
- config github login clientID and secret, edit server/config.js.
- run meteor

I have converted the original version to be fully customizable, any one who has a github account can use it.
